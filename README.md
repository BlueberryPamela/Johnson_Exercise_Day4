# Summer Reading Programs

Next to the benefits of playing and swimming all day long, 
reading is just about the most important thing kids can do this summer. 
So we put together this list of free kids summer reading programs 
to help keep the learning going over the next few months. 

**Share these kids summer reading programs with students!**

## Barnes & Noble

Kids can earn a **FREE book** after they read eights books and log 
them on the reading sheet. The Barnes and Noble kids summer reading 
program is _only available to children in grades 1–6._ 

Only one book is available for each child who completes a reading journal, 
and the choice must be made from the selected books available at the store.
